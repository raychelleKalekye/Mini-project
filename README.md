Our project is making a 8-pool ball
# 3D Pool Ball Renderer

This project creates a realistic 3D pool ball with the number "8" using Python and the Cairo graphics library. The ball features gradients, shadows, and highlights to give it a 3D look.

## Features
- Radial Gradient:  Creates the ball's spherical appearance.
- Shadowed White Circle: Adds depth around the number "8".
- Numbering: Displays a bold "8" in the center of the white circle.
- Highlight Spot: Mimics a light reflection for added realism.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- pycairo library for 2D graphics
- math library (included in Python's standard library)

### Installing pycairo
To install pycairo, use:
pip install pycairo
